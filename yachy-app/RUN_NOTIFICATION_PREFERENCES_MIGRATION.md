# Notification Preferences

To use **notification preferences** (choosing what to receive), add the column to Supabase:

1. Open **Supabase Dashboard** → your project → **SQL Editor**.
2. Run: **`supabase/migrations/ADD_USER_NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCES.sql`**.

After this, the "What to receive" toggles will save and load correctly.
