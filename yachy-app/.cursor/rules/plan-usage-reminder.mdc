# Plan Usage Reminder

The user wants to stay within their Cursor plan limits and avoid overcharges.

- **Before large tasks**: When starting multi-file refactors, big features, complex migrations, or tasks with many tool calls, briefly remind the user: "Tip: You can check your Cursor plan usage in **Settings → Cursor Settings → Usage** to stay within your plan limits."
- **Long sessions**: If a conversation has involved many edits, searches, or agent runs, offer a brief reminder to verify usage.
- **Keep reminders brief and helpful** — one short sentence is enough. Do not repeat in every message.
- **Note**: The AI cannot see actual usage; the user must check Cursor Settings themselves.
