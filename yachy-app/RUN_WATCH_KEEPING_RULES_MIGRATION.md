# Watch Keeping Rules table

To use **Watch Keeping Rules** (edit by HODs, view by crew), create the table in Supabase:

1. Open **Supabase Dashboard** → your project → **SQL Editor**.
2. Run the migration: **`supabase/migrations/CREATE_WATCH_KEEPING_RULES_TABLE.sql`**.

After this, the Watch Keeping hub will load and save rules per vessel.
