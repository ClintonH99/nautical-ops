# Muster Station & Duties Permissions

## Rule

- **Create, Edit, and Delete** for Muster Station & Duties: **ONLY HOD** can perform these actions.
- Crew can view published muster stations and download PDFs.

## Implementation

- HOD = `user?.role === 'HOD'`
- Create button: only visible when `isHOD`
- Edit and Delete buttons per muster station card: only visible when `isHOD`
- CreateMusterStationScreen (create and edit): HOD guard; non-HOD sees "Only HODs can create or edit muster stations."
