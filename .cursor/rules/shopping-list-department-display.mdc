# Shopping List Department Display

## Rule

For the Shopping List page and all content within:

- The **department icon/badge** on each shopping list entry must be **under the title**
- The department display must **NOT** be a clickable button

## Implementation

- Department badge: use a `View` (not `TouchableOpacity`) for display only
- Position: below the list title in a column layout
- Do not wrap the department in a touchable or make it open modals/pickers when tapped
