# Pre-Departure Checklist Permissions

## Rule

- **Department checklists** (Bridge, Engineering, Exterior, Interior, Galley): **ONLY HOD** can edit and delete.
- **Captain's checklist** (All Departments, `department === null`): **ONLY the Captain** can edit and delete.

## Implementation

- Captain = `user?.position?.toLowerCase() === 'captain'`
- HOD = `user?.role === 'HOD'`
- Captain's checklist = checklist with `department === null`

When adding permission checks, use:
- `canEditDepartmentChecklist` = `isHOD` for department-specific checklists
- `canEditCaptainChecklist` = `isCaptain` for the Captain's checklist (All Departments)
