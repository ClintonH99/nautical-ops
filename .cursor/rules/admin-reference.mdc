# ADMIN Folder - Mandatory Reference

## Rule

Before building, changing, or fixing any part of the app, you **MUST** read and apply the contents of the **ADMIN** folder as the source of truth.

## What ADMIN Contains

- **ADMIN/App Design/** - Fonts, colors, button styles, and all visual/design specs
- **ADMIN/Rules/** - Rules that govern how the app is built and maintained
- **ADMIN/Authorizations/** - User hierarchy, roles, permissions, and access rules

## When to Reference

- When adding new features
- When fixing bugs or UI issues
- When changing styles, layouts, or components
- When implementing or modifying permissions or role-based access
- When onboarding or changing user flows

## Behavior

Everything in ADMIN applies to **current and all future users** and changes. Treat ADMIN as the single source of truth. If ADMIN conflicts with existing code, ADMIN wins. Always consult ADMIN before starting any build or fix task.
