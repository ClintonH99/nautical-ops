# Web Sign-In Rule

**Rule:** On the website, users do NOT sign in with email/password. They use their phone app's credentials to gain access.

## Implementation

- **Web (platform === 'web')**: Default to LinkLogin (QR code) screen. Users scan the QR with the phone app (Settings → Link website) to authenticate the web session using the phone's existing session.
- **LoginScreen on web**: Redirects to LinkLogin—never show email/password form.
- **Copy**: Emphasize "Use your phone app—no credentials on this device."

## Never

- Show email/password as the primary sign-in option on web
- Allow web users to enter credentials on the laptop; the session comes from the phone

## Flow

1. User opens website on laptop
2. Website shows QR code (LinkLogin)
3. User opens phone app, goes to Settings → Link website, scans QR
4. Phone app claims the code with the user's session
5. Website receives the session and user is signed in
